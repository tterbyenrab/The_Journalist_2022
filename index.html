      <h1>The Journalist</h1>
      <h2>Editors: Hanna Varilek, Jeff Hill, Ana Chincoa</h2>
      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>The Journalist was a collaborative class project that mixed students from the following
         classes at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s journalism college: advanced reporting,
         copy editing, photography.  It began in the early 1970s and ran until around 1996.
         The paper was published in the final weeks of the fall and spring semesters. It was
         team-taught by tenured professors in the journalism department in hopes of preparing
         students for work in a newsroom upon graduation.</p>
      
      <p>This project was developed with the intent of analyzing the reporting styles and rhetoric surrounding the topic of abortions 
         and women’s rights within The Journalist. Issues printed between the years 1972 and 1989 exist as the focus for this analysis/edition.</p>
      
      <p>This Project was developed to fulfill necessary requirements for English 478/878: Digital Archives and Editions, Fall 2022.</p>
