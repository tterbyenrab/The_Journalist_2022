      <h1>Armstrong Advocates Men's Lib</h1><br/>
      <a>By Shelly Kalkowski</a>
      
      <p>Equal rights for women are fine, Charles Armstrong thinks men need to be liberated
         too.</p>
      
      <p>“If men can be chauvinists, then so can women,” he said. Armstrong is a former graduate
         student at the University of Nebraska Lincoln and has done work towards a master's
         thesis on men's liberation.</p>
      
      <p>A key element of female chauvinism, according to Armstrong, is the expectation that
         the man must be the bread winner.</p>
      
      <p>Other things men need to liberated from are the job stereotypes men are classified
         under and the idea that a "man" should not openly express his feelings, he said.</p>
      
      <p>"Women are jumping from the frying pan into the fire when they ask for equal rights,”
         Armstrong said. “They are going from sexual oppression to economic oppression.”</p>
      
      <p>The solution, Armstrong said he believes, lies in a guaranteed income that would free
         men, and women, from economic coercion.</p>
      
      <p>"Men also need to be liberated from the stereotypes of jock, super-stud and unfeeling
         machine,” he said.</p>
      
      <p>Armstrong said an Army manual that said an officer should not be seen carrying a baby
         was a good example of  this stereotyping.</p>
      
      <p>"Many people see a man as some sort of machine--an unfeeling robot-- that is not supposed
         to show any human feelings, such as crying,” Armstrong said. “I see men's liberation
         as trying to free yourself from the stereotype being imposed upon you.”</p>
      
      <p>"Maybe what we need is equal rights for chauvinists."</p>
